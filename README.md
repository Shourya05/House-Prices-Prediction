# House-Prices-Prediction
This Project solves a regression problem of predicting house prices with the help of an Artificial Neural Network.
In this project first the exploratory analysis is done to find how the closely the different features are related to the price of the house
and if a particular feature does not have any  relationship with the price of the house then those features are dropped from the dataframe.
Then the dataset is split into training and testing data ,normalized and then the training data is passed to the ANN.
The ANN uses only linear activation functions Since it is a regression problem.
Finally the model is evaluated on the basis of the test data,
This model has a test accuracy of approx 80%.

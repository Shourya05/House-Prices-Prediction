# House-Prices-Prediction
This Project solves a regression problem of predicting house prices with the help of an Artificial Neural Network.
In this project first the exploratory analysis is done to find how the closely the different features are related to the price of the house
and if a particular feature does not have any  relationship with the price of the house then those features are dropped from the dataframe.
